My Form Lab
Overview
For this project, I located a form design resource to serve as inspiration for creating a form. Following the steps outlined in the task overview, I cloned a form based on the chosen resource, focusing on the frontend development aspect only.

Steps Taken
Finding a Form: I explored the Form Design Resource provided to find a suitable form for my project.
Designing My Form: Using HTML and CSS, I crafted a form similar to the one I found in the resource. I paid attention to details such as layout, styling, and functionality.
Hosting My Form: After completing the form's design, I hosted it on GitHub Pages to make it accessible to others.
